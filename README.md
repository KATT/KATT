### Hi there! ðŸ˜»

I am Alex, a fully-stacked TypeScript consultant from Sweden & the main guy behind [**tRPC**](https://trpc.io).

Been doing html since the late 90s, started [a company selling Counter-Strike servers](https://web.archive.org/web/20061112194431/http://www.ociusservers.com/) & got my first official coding job in 2009. Since then, I have been on 5 continents, lived/worked on 3, and worked for everything from sub 5 people startups to big banks.

From Sweden, living in Stockholm. Speak Swedish, English and rusty (Brazilian) Portuguese + Spanish.
