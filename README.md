### Hi there! ðŸ˜»

I am a fully-stacked TypeScript consultant & the main guy behind [**tRPC**](https://trpc.io).
<!-- 
Got in to programming by making websites in the late 90s and started [a company selling Counter-Strike servers](https://web.archive.org/web/20061112194431/http://www.ociusservers.com/) at 16.

I was one of the founding engineers at [dice.fm](https://dice.fm) back in 2014, leading all the web dev etc - since leaving that Iâ€™ve been doing contracting & yesterday I just left my own VC-funded startup here in Stockholm where I was the co-founding house geek/CTO.
