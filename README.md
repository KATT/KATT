## Hi there! ðŸ˜»

I am Alex, a fully-stacked TypeScripter from Sweden & the creator of [**tRPC**](https://trpc.io).

Been doing html since the late 90s, started [a company](https://web.archive.org/web/20061112194431/http://www.ociusservers.com/) in 2006 selling Counter-Strike servers & got my first official coding job in 2009. Since then, I have been on 5 continents, lived/worked on 3, and worked for everything from sub 5 people startups to big banks - as a consultant, employee, and founder.

From Sweden, living in Stockholm. Speak Swedish, English and rusty (Brazilian) Portuguese + Spanish.


## Work with me!

You can [contact me](https://cal.com/alexander) for contracting opportunities or if you want to talk to me about what you're building with tRPC.

If you are using my OSS-work for your company or just like what I do - I'd really appreciate if you would consider [sponsoring me](https://github.com/sponsors/KATT); there's nothing that gives me more energy than a token of appreciation.
